## About Giftably

Giftably is a web application that helps users find the perfect gift. Think of Giftably as a catalog maker. When searching for gifts, it's hard to find a collection of items that fits the recipient. There are countless magazine articles that curate collections for their readers to buy from, but those articles are usually very general and don't really fit your giftee. What Giftably does is that it allows the user to browse through a collection of items curated for the user based on their traits.

Users are given prompts so they can fill in, and they are able to skip prompts if they don't like it by entering in nothing. They are able to add up to three tags to curate the collection from. Giftably uses Amazon's Rainforest API to retrieve products and it uses a combination search of each prompt to curate the collection. Users are then able to browse the collection and filter/sort it based on their needs.

Built with HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, Node, & JQuery

## Giftably Brand and UI
I think gifts are something fun that brings out happiness and I wanted to reflect that in it's UI. I used very bold borders/text, and bright colours to make the website really pop and convey playfulness. The same is reflected in the logo. And to add on to that even more, I created two cute little characters (Bo the Bunny & Cy the Shiba). I think they also liven the website up. The animations I chose to use also reflects this point as it incorporates a lot of movement like sliding and bouncing.
